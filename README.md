# Bootlet

Bootlet is a minimal Linux that boots before the main OS, providing a quick access to simple tools and a selection of operating systems to boot into.

You are dropped into a shell environment less than a second after the computer logo appears. You can pair [Bootit](https://github.com/mincomk/bootit) with Bootlet to get `it windows`, `it linux` command to boot into your favorite OS directly from Bootlet.
